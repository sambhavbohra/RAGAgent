# Assignment 03 — Google NotebookLM

# RAG

## Problem Statement

Build your own version of **Google NotebookLM** — a RAG-powered application where a user
can upload any document and have a conversation with it.
The user uploads a file. The system processes it, stores it intelligently, and allows the user to
ask natural language questions — getting back answers grounded in the document's actual
content.

## What You Are Building

A full RAG pipeline with a working interface where:
● A user can upload a document (PDF or plain text)
● The system chunks, embeds, and indexes the document into a vector database
● The user can ask questions about the document
● The system retrieves the most relevant chunks and generates a grounded answer using
an LLM
● Answers must come from the document — not from the LLM's general knowledge

## What is Expected

```
● A working application — CLI or simple web UI, your choice
● The full RAG pipeline must be implemented end to end: ingestion → chunking →
embedding → storage → retrieval → generation
● At least one chunking strategy must be implemented and clearly documented
● A vector database must be used for storing and retrieving embeddings
● The LLM must use retrieved context to answer — not answer from memory alone
● The app must handle a document it has never seen before and answer questions
correctly from it
```

## Submission

Submit both of the following on the course portal:

1. **GitHub Repository Link** — must be public
2. **Live Project Link** — deployed and accessible without any local setup
Submissions missing either will not be evaluated.
